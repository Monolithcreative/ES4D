### Setup guide

1. **Select Appropriate Hardware:**
   - **Components:** Choose components compatable with the (Filecoin hardware requirements)[https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/get-started/hardware-requirements/]. Remove stickers, adhesives, or materials that could deteriorate in your chosen liquid.
   - **Compatibility:** Ensure that the materials of the internal components are compatible with the cooling fluid to avoid corrosion or other damage.
   
2. **Select a Dielectric Coolant:**
   - Choose a coolant that is non-conductive and compatible with your server components.
   - Consider factors like cooling capacity, environmental impact, and safety.
   - Explore responsible alternatives: Vegetible glycerine + propelyn glycol + citric acid. Or just mineral oil... Synthetics are great for compute but not great for the environment, we advise for the adoption and development of better alternatives where possible.
3. **Precautions:**
   - **Ventilation:** Ensure adequate ventilation to disperse any fumes or vapors from your chosen fluid.
   - **PPE:** Use personal protective equipment when handling vapourous coolants.
   - **Spillage Plan:** Prepare for accidental spillage to minimize risk. Use spill matts on the floor whilst draining and filling.
   - **Cooling:** Immersion cooling is very efficient; ensure that you have enough heat rejection to fully optimise the system, keep temperatures low, and working life long.

4. **Prepare the Server:**
   - **Cleaning:** Clean all server components thoroughly to remove dust, dirt, or other contaminants. Typically we use alcohol spray.
   - **Removal:** Remove components that are not compatible with fluids, such as fans and certain plastics or adhesives.
   - **Sealing:** (If making your own) be sure to leak test before a full install.

5. **Installation of the Server:**
   - **Orientation:** Position the server and cables to allow optimal circulation of coolant around components.
   - **Connections:** Make sure power and data connections are accessible and secure.

7. **Testing and Monitoring:**
   - **Test:** Power up the server and monitor its performance to ensure stable operation.
   - **Temperature:** Regularly check the temperature to confirm efficient cooling.
   - **Maintenance:** Schedule regular inspections and maintenance to ensure optimal performance.

8. **Documentation and Training:**
   - **Documentation:** Document the setup, operation, and maintenance processes.
   - **Training:** Train staff on safety protocols and emergency procedures.

9. **Maintenance:**
   - **Coolant:** Regularly check and maintain the quality of the coolant.
   - **Components:** Inspect server components for any signs of corrosion or wear.

10. **Emergency Protocols:**
   - Establish and communicate emergency protocols for coolant leaks, overheating, or other issues.
