### Project Description

The digital universe is expected to double in size every two years, a rate that is increasing. However, the energy, water, and CO2 costs associated with this growth are often overlooked. The ICT industry is responsible for about 4% of global energy consumption and 2%-3% of CO2 emissions, though these figures are likely underestimated. With 2.5 billion people lacking reliable access to electricity and the ICT industry's power consumption predicted to increase by 50% by 2040, there is a pressing need for more energy-efficient practices.

To address excessive energy and CO2 emissions, the focus should be on the heat produced by server and storage infrastructure and the energy required for cooling. Traditional air-conditioning methods, which are energy and water-intensive, can be replaced with immersion cooling. This technique uses a non-conductive liquid to capture heat and is significantly more efficient.

ES4D is a newly designed solution that employs immersive and heat recovery technologies to tackle these issues. It is a proof of concept for the Filecoin ecosystem, utilizing 3D printing with circular economy bioplastic to reduce data center e-waste and energy costs significantly.

### Value
- Increased green credentials and reputation of the filecoin ecosystem, and specifically those of any SP’s adopting the technology
- Reduction of SP’s energy consumption and costs therefore increasing ecosystem efficiency
- Easier adoption of renewable energy due to reduced energy requirement
- Reduction of SP infrastructure costs due to increased working life of server/storage components
- Increased rack density resulting in lower data centre footprint

The risk of not adopting and investing in greener technology solutions would be that the Filecoin ecosystem could be perceived as not embracing sustainability. Enterprise and SME clients often have policies in place which mandate working with suppliers who are able to demonstrate strong environmental policies and commitments. With greater adoption of greener technologies the Filecoin ecosystem can not only promote it’s green credentials, it is more likely to onboard datasets belonging to clients looking for green alternatives to existing providers.

### Maintenance and Upgrade Plans (Lots More Coming Soon!)

We shall continue to refine and document the solution allowing the community to build and maintain their own installations, however the ultimate intention is to develop an open source configuration which can be shared and developed by the community allowing SP’s to cost-effectively refine, upgrade, and maintain their own customised installations if so desired.

We are working with hardware vendors closely connected to the Filecoin ecosystem with the intention of building and deploying production ready systems which can then be deployed by the community as a fully qualified Filecoin solution.
